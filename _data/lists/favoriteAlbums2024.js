  title: "Favorite Albums of 2024",
  "description": [
    "While 2024 didn't bring as many bangers as the nearly-unparalleled super-stacked 2023, 2024 turned out to be the years of surprises. A good half of the albums listed below are by bands I'd never _heard_ of, let alone heard any music by. Which means that I brought a ton of new bands, new sounds, and new music into the fold in 2024. A great year overall.",
    "Somewhat curiously, eight of my picks hail from Nordic locales. Another six are from England. I guess I know where I like my music to come from."

      additionalText: `For some reason the weekly-curated "New Music" playlist on Apple Music brought me "The Dog Song" off this five-year-old album, and, boy, am I sure glad it did. That lone curation opened up a album of pure tight progressive-rock joy completely out of the blue. I listened to the album at least a dozen times digitally before importing the vinyl from a little house in the Netherlands countryside, and then I kept that platter spinning at least another dozen times. This is one of those albums that when I think about it, I want to listen to it immediately.`

The Frost*-y influences here are clear, but so is the freshness, playfulness, and inventiveness that comes with every album by the original blokes. _Mannequin_ was my introduction to Kyros, and the collosal listening experience reminds me of when I first listened to _also_-English prog masters Haken and their major effort _The Mountain_: I've heard something spectacular, and I'll be keeping up on this band for a long, long time.`

After its March 1st release, I ordered the vinyl set based on how many times I'd put on the "Miramare" single alone; after the arrival, for a couple weeks I started every work morning by spinning this album from beginning to end. I haven't always sat in on Big Big Train's hedgerows and pastures English-swaddled progressive rock (though I might count 2019's Grand Tour on the long list of all-time favorites). But this album has a folksy, er, richness that really hit the spot in 2024.`

      secondary: "Frost*",
      additionalText: `One of the many great things about Frost*, a band I've followed since their landmark prog release _Milliontown_ in 2006, is that a new release means an album that both sounds like Frost* while it attempts a whole batch of things new to the band. So for _Life in the Wires_, the prominent new wrinkle is a concept album: a science-fiction concept about the search for a mysterious broadcast heard through a transistor radio. It sprawls a bit more than the usual Frost* LP, but it also compels more effectively than the usual song-based album. And so Frost* continues their streak of albums that know when to soar and when to stay firmly grounded, bouyed by the exceptional talent that knows the difference between playing big and just sounding big. And, man, I love a good concept album.`

      additionalText: `We may never get a 00's-era Porcupine Tree album again, but the variety and confidence in this album by Mile Marker Zero makes me feel a lot better about the dismal chances of a _Deadwing 2_. This band has my periphery for several years, but _Coming of Age_ finally brought me in. Plenty of strong sounds here; the title track is a particular favorite.`

      additionalText: `An all-time favorite band soars again with _Clear Cold Beyond_ after hitting the skids with 2019's utterly tepid and forgettable _Talviyö_. Band leader Tony Kakko has mentioned that he takes fault and blame for the progressive and tonal meandering of the band for the past fifteen or so (which wasn't all bad, though Talviyö clearly showed that phase of the band ran out of gas), and this 2024 album was his attempt to get the band back on track. Though I'd never fault a band for trying new things and seeing where the songs take them – bands are made of people, and people change! – Sonata Arctica never really felt wholly comfortable in the many attempts at fitting into a progressive groove. So when Clear Cold Beyond trades prog for power, the foundation sounds stronger than it has in a long time, bringing forth a rollicking batch of power metal bangers. And since this album has a bit of a feel of these Finnish lads finding their feet again, I'm very much looking forward to what they do next.`

      additionalText: `Fellowship released their first album _The Saberlight Chronicles_ in 2022, and that batch of power metal was a once-in-a-decade level release. If the band had decided to hang it up after that stellar freshman release, I would've been disappointed but understood completely. But here we are, two years later, and this young group of goofy English metallers brought us a new platter of happy power metal tunes. _The Skies Above Eternity_ isn't up to the level of _The Saberlight Chronicles_, but, boy, it is still a heck of a power metal album. Any other band would be happy and grateful to have this lone album in their back catalog; for Fellowship, they have it _and_ one even better. The sky's the limit with these boys.`

      additionalText: `As I write this on Feburary 18th, 2025, I learn that this Finnish frenetic pop-metalcore group was disbanded less than a month ago due to child grooming allegations against one of the founders. I could talk about how this album filled a happy-metal hole in my listening needs that was previously filled by similarly-energetic Swedish neighbors Amaranthe, who also released an album in 2024. Amaranthe's new album was so impactless that I forgot it exists, and I was excited with a future forward with One Morning Left, captivated by the verve of this energy drink of an album. But no more attention is deserved towards this album or its band.`

      additionalText: `I have all three vinyls for all three Bluey albums, including this one, in my collection. This new one ranks second-best in the collection, ranking lower than the excellent first album but higher than the sugar-rush effectiveness of _Dance Mode!_. The adapations and expansions to songs from the various episodes continues to be truly winning, as favorite tunes and memories get bigger and better, giving ample opporunity to showcase the top-tier songwriting and musicianship. Just like the show, and like the titular "Rug Island" episode, this album has playfulness, fun, and creativity, but also plenty of warmth. If this is the last album for the TV show – lead writer Joe Brumm is finishing his _Bluey_ involvement with a movie, leaving room for a movie album? – it's a great one to go out on.`

I've seen the word used to describe this beefy block of death metal, an chock album of coarse walls of guitars and growls, pierced with clean vocals to balance the sludge, like sunlight breaking through storm clouds. And you know what? It's pretty epic. The album just feels _heavy_, both musically and conceptually. Each listen left a lasting impression on me, like I'd witnessed a landscape that was grim and cheerless but still beautiful. I don't dip my toes into the darker metal realms much, but with albums like this one, I'm starting to realize I may need to dive in.`

That album had a feeling of boldness, daring and frontier; _Charcoal Grace_, on the heels of its stillborn older sibling, feels like a family trying to find a way forward after a storm destroyed their house. It has strength but also somber realization and open wounds in the midst of recovery.`

(I wore earplugs to concerts both before and after that one. So I had no excuse at the _Alcest_ show.) In 2024, these Frenchies released this fine album that an [Angry Metal Guy reviewer described as evoking late summer](https://www.angrymetalguy.com/alcest-les-chants-de-laurore-review/), and I wouldn't even try to come up with a better comparison. The LP has the embrace of seasonal warmth and the fading light as the colder months approach. _Chants_ feels like the memories of days in the sun are already beginning to fade. And as the cherry on top, if this was a list of best album art, _Les Chants_ might've won the top spot.`

Complete unabashed fun – you can imagine the giant grins of the musicians as they blast through track after track. Though I'm not typically hooked by adjective-less metal – no power, no death, not even any thrash, just capital-M Metal – this one has a speed and joy that hooks deep.`

Much to my surprise, when I revisited _Eviscerate_ at the end of the year, while I still found the first half the LP sharp and relentless as ever, the second half of the album repeatedly failed to keep my attention. An album that's only half killer is, well, not much of an album. Though a disappointment for this list, _Eviscerate_ still has a lot to enjoy, particularly in that scorching first half and the final full-length tune "Golgotha Compendium: Fifth Temple," a bookend that demonstrates Eidola can even play a bit in the progressive realm.`

Which is a bit sad, because Nightwish was one of the original bands to get me into power metal − and really, got me into metal as a whole, broadening my musical universe to this day − in the first place. So I was encouraged that Yesterwynde almost brought me back into the fold, the first time since 2011's Imaginaerum. Alas, it didn't win out against the other power-metal-ful releases of the year. But it does give me hope that Nightwish's next release will bring me back even closer to where it all started."
