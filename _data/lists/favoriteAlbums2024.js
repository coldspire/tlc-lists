  title: "Favorite Albums of 2024",
  "description": [
    "While 2024 didn't bring as many bangers as the nearly-unparalleled super-stacked 2023, 2024 turned out to be the years of surprises. A good half of the albums listed below are by bands I'd never _heard_ of, let alone heard any music by. Which means that I brought a ton of new bands, new sounds, and new music into the fold in 2024. A great year overall.",
    "Somewhat curiously, eight of my picks hail from Nordic locales. Another six are from England. I guess I know where I like my music to come from.",
    "Also, note that I don't restrict my list to albums _released_ in 2024, although most of the below albums were indeed new in 2024."

      additionalText: `For some reason the weekly-curated "New Music" playlist on Apple Music brought me "The Dog Song" off this five-year-old album, and, boy, am I sure glad it did. That lone curation opened up a album of pure tight progressive-rock joy completely out of the blue. I listened to the album at least a dozen times digitally before importing the vinyl from a little house in the Netherlands countryside, and then I kept that platter spinning at least another dozen times. This is one of those albums that when I think about it, I want to listen to it immediately.`

      additionalText: `During the 00s, when Luca Turilli and his fellow Italians in Rhapsody were ripping it up and churning out symphonic power metal platinum, I was there for it. Those albums had operatic neo-classical energy as strong as a thousand suns, but you know what they didn't have? A half-decent, compelling fantasy concept, in any regard. Turilli released five LPs and one EP in his "Emerald Sword Saga", and, frankly, only _Dawn of Victory_ had _songs_ with compelling concepts, let alone an entire album reaching any cohesive narrative achievement. Jump ahead a couple decades, after Rhapsody split and rejoined multiple times, and we have this gem of an album by Azure. I'm not going to say I fully get (or enjoy) the story of Fym and the titular character's adventures, but listening to Fym _feels_ like a journey. Between the playful narritive-driven lyrics and the expansive lush music, Fym brings everything to the table and plays with it gleefully.Because of the wonderful music and the exquisite vocal performance of the band lead, a song on Fym reveals bears extra dimensions, like watching a live musical on a stage, where the blocking and acting boosts the music to another level. The world of Fym as created by Azure feels rich and fantastical like no other album I've ever heard.`

      additionalText: `Few albums are a pure delightful showcase like this one. Not only is the musicianship top-notch, but the effortless playfulness, confidence, and variety is unmatched by any of my other picks. To think you have a handle on _Swagger & Stroll_ just means you're due for another listen – there are multitudes here to abosrb and relish. I mean, the first five tracks include a Chicano-rock song, a electro-gypsy-swing song, and a Celtic pop-punk song, with good amounts of progressive metal and soaring pop mixed in. And there are about ten more songs after that, during which the momentum and joy continue unabated. An utterly extrodinary album, one unlike anything I've ever heard.`

The Frost*-y influences here are clear, but so is the freshness, playfulness, and inventiveness that comes with every album by the original blokes. _Mannequin_ was my introduction to Kyros, and the collosal listening experience reminds me of when I first listened to _also_-English prog masters Haken and their major effort _The Mountain_: I've heard something spectacular, and I'll be keeping up on this band for a long, long time.`

After its March 1st release, I ordered the vinyl set based on how many times I'd put on the "Miramare" single alone; after the arrival, for a couple weeks I started every work morning by spinning this album from beginning to end. I haven't always sat in on Big Big Train's hedgerows and pastures English-swaddled progressive rock (though I might count 2019's Grand Tour on the long list of all-time favorites). But this album has a folksy, er, richness that really hit the spot in 2024.`

These Danish "math-stadium rockers," as described by the [official band site](https://www.isbjorg.dk), XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. The single "Solitare" opened the doors to me, with its XXXXXXXXXX and saxophone solos, and the rest of the album XXXXXXXXXX`

      secondary: "Frost*",
      additionalText: `One of the many great things about Frost*, a band I've followed since their landmark prog release _Milliontown_ in 2006, is that a new release means an album that both sounds like Frost* while it attempts a whole batch of things new to the band. So for _Life in the Wires_, the prominent new wrinkle is a concept album: a science-fiction story about the search for a mysterious broadcast heard through a hardware transistor radio in a world where such things, radios and over-the-air transmissions, shouldn't exist. _Life_ sprawls a bit more than the usual Frost* LP, but it also drives ahead more effectively too. And so Frost* continues their streak of albums that know when to soar and when to stay firmly grounded, bouyed by the exceptional talent that knows the difference between playing big and just sounding big. And, man, I love a good concept album.`

      additionalText: `We may never get a 00's-era Porcupine Tree album again, but the variety and confidence in this progressive album by Mile Marker Zero makes me feel a lot better about the dismal chances of a _Deadwing 2_. This band has been in my periphery for several years, and when I finally set my sights on _Coming of Age_, I was finally brought in. Plenty of strong sounds here; the title track is a particular favorite.`

      additionalText: `Fellowship released their first album _The Saberlight Chronicles_ in 2022, and that batch of power metal was a once-in-a-decade level release. If the band had decided to hang it up after that stellar freshman release, I would've been disappointed but understood completely. But here we are, two years later, and this young group of goofy English metallers brought us a new platter of happy power metal tunes. _The Skies Above Eternity_ isn't up to the level of _The Saberlight Chronicles_, but, boy, it is still a heck of a power metal album. Any other band would be happy and grateful to have this lone album in their back catalog; for Fellowship, they have it _and_ one even better. The sky's the limit with these boys.`

      primary: "Clear Cold Beyond",
      secondary: "Sonata Arctica",
      additionalText: `An all-time favorite band soars again with _Clear Cold Beyond_ after hitting the skids with 2019's utterly tepid and forgettable _Talviyö_. Band leader Tony Kakko has mentioned that he takes fault and blame for the progressive and tonal meandering of the band for the past fifteen or so (which wasn't all bad, though Talviyö clearly showed that phase of the band ran out of gas), and this 2024 album was his attempt to get the band back on track. Though I'd never fault a band for trying new things and seeing where the songs take them – bands are made of people, and people change! – Sonata Arctica never really felt wholly comfortable in the many attempts at fitting into a progressive groove. So when Clear Cold Beyond trades prog for power, the foundation sounds stronger than it has in a long time, bringing forth a rollicking batch of power metal bangers. And since this album has a bit of a feel of these Finnish lads finding their feet again, I'm very much looking forward to what they do next.`

      additionalText: `On Feburary 18th, 2025, as I write this, I learn that this Finnish frenetic pop-metalcore group was disbanded less than a month ago due to child grooming allegations against one of the founders. I could talk about how this album filled a happy-metal hole in my listening needs that was previously filled by similarly-energetic Swedish neighbors Amaranthe, who also released an album in 2024. Amaranthe's new album was so impactless that I forgot it exists, and I was excited by One Morning Left providing multiple future albums of electricity, captivated by the verve of this energy drink of an album. But the time for One Morning Left is over, and sounds like it should've never made it this far.`

      additionalText: `I have all three vinyls for all three Bluey albums, including this one, in my collection. This new one ranks second-best in the collection, ranking lower than the excellent first album but higher than the sugar-rush effectiveness of _Dance Mode!_ The adapations and expansions to songs from the various episodes continues to be truly winning, as favorite tunes and memories get bigger and better, giving ample opporunity to showcase the top-tier songwriting and musicianship. Just like the show, and like the [titular "Rug Island" episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91ACUGnqVOE), this album has playfulness, fun, and creativity, but also plenty of warmth. If this is the last album for the TV show – lead writer Joe Brumm is finishing his _Bluey_ involvement with a movie, leaving room for a movie album, perhaps – it's a great one to go out on.`

      additionalText: `Among words used to describe metal albums, especially albums wide in scope and with a large dynamic sound, there is no word more overused than "epic." I've seen the word used to describe this beefy block of death metal, an album chock full of coarse walls of guitars and growls, pierced with clean vocals to balance the sludge, like sunlight breaking through storm clouds. And you know what? It's pretty epic. The album just feels _heavy_, both musically and conceptually. Each listen left a lasting impression on me, like I'd witnessed a landscape that was grim and cheerless but still beautiful. I don't dip my toes into the darker metal realms much, but with albums like this one, I realize I'm missing out.`

      secondary: "Myrath",
      additionalText: `Now this is a beautiful slab of big, earnest, symphonic-esque prog metal, though this Tunisian band calls it "blazing desert metal," which sounds way better. A lot of symphonic metal bands do symphonic elements, and they do metal elements, but do not do a good job of combining those elements. And when done poorly, the music sounds labored, contrived, and bloated. But when done well, as in the case of _Karma_, the musical landscape is bold and luxurious with a sweeping breadth of sound. Myrath plays _big_ on this album, and the result has all the bravado and vigor of a glorious desert-sands adventure.`

      additionalText: `The liner notes for _Charcoal Grace_ mention how the band's previous album, _Rise Radiant_, was never fully known by the band by being released at the start of the COVID-19 epidemic, depriving it of tour-provided oxygen from the start. That album had a feeling of boldness, daring and frontier; _Charcoal Grace_, on the heels of its stillborn older sibling, feels like a family trying to find a way forward after a storm destroyed their house. It has strength but also somber realization and open wounds in the midst of recovery. A weighty platter of songs, with "The Stormchaser" being one of my 2024 favorites.`

      additionalText: `Several years ago I saw Alcest live as the opener for an Anathema show, and this post-metal band cemented themselves in my musical history by playing so loud that they caused me permanent hearing damage. (I wore earplugs to concerts both before and after that one. So I had no excuse at the Alcest show.) In 2024, these Frenchies released this fine album that an [Angry Metal Guy reviewer described as evoking late summer](https://www.angrymetalguy.com/alcest-les-chants-de-laurore-review/), and I wouldn't even try to come up with a better comparison. The LP has the embrace of seasonal warmth and the fading light as the colder months approach. It feels like the memories of days in the sun are already beginning to fade. And as the cherry on top, if this was a list of best album art, _Les Chants_ might've won the top spot.`

Complete unabashed fun – you can imagine the giant grins of the musicians as they blast through track after track. Though I'm not typically hooked by adjective-less metal – no power, no death, not even any thrash, just capital-M Metal – this one has a speed and joy that hooks deep.`

Much to my surprise, when I revisited _Eviscerate_ at the end of the year, while I still found the first half the LP sharp and relentless as ever, the second half of the album repeatedly failed to keep my attention. An album that's only half killer is, well, not much of an album. Though a disappointment for this list, _Eviscerate_ still has a lot to enjoy, particularly in that scorching first half and the final full-length tune "Golgotha Compendium: Fifth Temple," a bookend that demonstrates Eidola can even play a bit in the progressive realm.`

Which is a bit sad, because Nightwish was one of the original bands to get me into power metal − and really, got me into metal as a whole, broadening my musical universe to this day − in the first place. So I was encouraged that Yesterwynde almost brought me back into the fold, the first time since 2011's Imaginaerum. Alas, it didn't win out against the other power-metal-ful releases of the year. But it does give me hope that Nightwish's next release will bring me back even closer to where it all started."
