       Also, in the realm of how music hits us in strange ways: This song has one of the most simple and effective piano chord progressions I've heard in a long, long time. It's just a few chords, located around the middle of the song, but it's, like, _perfect_. Every time I hear the first two chords, I'm on the edge of my seat waiting for that third chord, even though I know exactly how it goes. And when that final chord lands, it's _just right._`

      additionalText: `This is the first Nightwish song I've enjoyed in several years. Nightwish and I just don't gel as well in recent years, due to the band songwriting moving away from the gothic power/prog roots and more towards towards sweeping orchestration and symphony. But "An Ocean Of Strange Islands" brings me back some of that big dark Nightwish power, where they do a type of grounded symphonic power metal that soars and sweeps but never strays too far from a devilish grimness. 
      
      Overall Nightwish moved on, and I didn't keep up. But feeling some of the old spark that only Nightwish could ignite sure is nice.`

      additionalText: `This manic song was my first taste of _Falling In Reverse_, bandleader Ronnie Radke's bad-boi revue. It was and still is good for a sugar rush, in part because of its dedication to the two halves of the bit: It starts as full-throated hip hop and ends as an over-driven metal cranker. In the end, the LP where this single resided was ultimately indigestible, with its self-aggrandizement and tough-guy posturing cranked up to an intolerable degree. But, man, this song is pretty dang loud and pretty dang fun.`
